# Demo Rollup

This is a _research-only_ demo runing the Sovereign SDK, "election" example on Celestia. None of its code is
suitable for production use. It contains known security flaws and numerous inefficiencies.

## Celestia Integration

The current prototype runs against Celestia-node version `v0.7.1`. This is the version used on the `arabica` testnet
as of Mar 18, 2023.

## Warning

This is a research prototype. It contains known vulnerabilities and should not be used in production under any
circumstances.

## Getting Started

### Set up Celestia

Sync a Celestia light node running on the Arabica testnet

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node.git`.
1. `cd celestia-node`
1. Checkout the code at v0.7.1: `git checkout tags/v0.7.1`
1. Build and install the celestia binary: `make build && make go-install`
1. Build celestia's key management tool `make cel-key`
1. Initialize the node: `celestia light init --p2p.network arabica`
1. Start the node with rpc on port 11111: `celestia light start --core.ip https://limani.celestia-devops.dev --p2p.network arabica --gateway --rpc.port 11111`
1. Obtain a JWT for RPC access: `celestia light auth admin --p2p.network arabica`
1. Copy the JWT and and save it in main.rs as `const CELESTIA_NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`. Be careful to paste the entire JWT - it may wrap across several lines in your terminal.
1. Wait a few minutes for your Celestia node to sync. It needs to have reached at least block `293681` before the demo can run properly.

Once your Celestia node is up and running, simply `cargo run` to test out the prototype.

## What is it?

This demo rollapp runs a simple on-chain election. Voting opened at block `293681`, and all votes are recorded on chain. This prototype scans
the Celestia chain for votes, and prints out the election results after each Celestia block. All relevant data is persisted in the node's database,
including all rollup state and history, and the Celestia header chain.
